A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

# ⚖️ BMI Calculator




A clean and efficient application designed to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) and provide health categorization based on World Health Organization (WHO) standards.

## 🚀 Features

* **Unit Support:** Calculate BMI using Metric (kg/cm) units.
* **Instant Categorization:** Automatically classifies results into Underweight, Normal Weight, Overweight, or Obese categories.
* **Input Validation:** Prevents errors by ensuring non-negative and realistic height/weight entries.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple command-line interface (CLI) for quick usage.

## 🧮 How It Works

The application uses the standard formula for calculating BMI:

$$BMI = \frac{weight (kg)}{height (m)^2}$$

*(Note: For imperial units, the formula includes a conversion factor of 703.)*

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Dart Language:**
* **Compiler & Environment:** Visual Studio Code
